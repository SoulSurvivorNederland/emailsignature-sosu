## How to customize?
Unless your name is `[NAAM]` and your function is `[FUNCTION]`, you'd probably like to customize your signature. Here's how:
* Open `signature.html` in your favorite text editor
* Change `[NAAM]` with your name (be aware of encoding)
* Change `[FUNCTION]` with your function title (be aware of encoding)

If you're not sure on this encoding thing, check out some online encoders [on Google](https://www.google.nl/search?q=online%20html%20encoding&rct=j).
